// Tx represents an immutable transaction. The constructor will compute the
// hash, which it will return directly from the Hash method. This means that the
// hash is only computed once. However, it is important note that the
// transaction fields should not be changed, because the hash will not be
// correct.
//
// This is intended for use in node internals, primarily mempool and consensus
// engine where the hash is repeatedly accessed on deep call stacks.
//
// In most cases, you should use the Tx type from the core/types package. Be
// aware of the cost of computing the hash, and avoid recomputing it.
//
// If you use this type, be aware of the mutability caveat, and consider the
// cost of the memory allocation, and the persistence of the hash potentially
// after it is no longer needed.

// recomputation. As such, the transaction fields should not be changed since
