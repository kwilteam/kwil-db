-- An epoch is a group of rewards that are issued in a given time/block range.
-- Epochs have 3 states:
-- 1. Created: the epoch is created and the rewards are being distributed
-- 2. Ended: the epoch has ended and the rewards are finalized
-- 3. Confirmed: the epoch has been confirmed on chain
-- Ideally, Kwil would have a unique indexes on this table where "confirmed" is null (to enforce only one active epoch at a time),
-- but this requires partial indexes which are not yet supported in Kwil
-- Because we need an epoch to issue reward to, but you should not issue reward to a finalized reward,
-- thus we'll always have two epochs at the same time(except the very first epoch),
-- one is finalized and waiting to be confirmed, the other is collecting new rewards.
