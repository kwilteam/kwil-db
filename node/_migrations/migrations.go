// package migrations implements a long-running migrations protocol for Kwil.
// This allows networks to upgrade to new networks over long periods of time,
// without any downtime.
//
// The process is as follows:
//
//  1. A network votes to create a new network. If enough votes are attained, the process is started.
//
//  2. Once the process is started, each validator should create a new node to run the new network, which will
//     connect to their current node. This new node will forward all changes from the old network to the new network.
//
//  3. The two networks will run in parallel until the old network reaches the scheduled shutdown block. At this point,
//     the new network will take over and the old network will be shut down.
//
// The old network cannot deploy databases, drop them, transfer balances, vote on any resolutions, or change their validator power.
//
// For more information on conflict resolution, see https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/wiki/Long%E2%80%90Running-Network-Migrations
