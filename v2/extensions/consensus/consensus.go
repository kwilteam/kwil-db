// Package consensus is used to apply customized rules for activation of
// hardforks defined in the genesis file.
//
// The goal of this as an extension is to minimize the need to modify internal
// kwild code to define coordinated changes to certain common or likely
// consensus rules.
//
// main capabilities:
//   - new transaction payload types, or payload versions
//   - modifications (add/remove/update) to the registered authenticators
//   - modifications to registered resolutions (governance-initiated transactions)
//   - configurable / pluggable serialization scheme
//   - consensus engine parameter updates, such as block size or other limits
//   - one time actions at activation height (see ethereum's TheDAO state changes),
//     like transferring or minting tokens, decreed validator set updates, special
//     dataset modifications - resolution-like actions that must be in tandem with
//     code and app logic change.
//
// The genesis files forks section may reference canonical forks defined in
// kwild code with named helpers like IsMyLogicV2(height uint64) switching
// between logic at any location. That requires kwild code updates; this
// consensus extension package aims to allow definition of custom hard fork
// aliases, that may modify the logic in certain well-defined ways. Arbitrary
// changes to kwild consensus logic may require changes to kwild internals (as
// is the standard approach in most blockchains), or adding new capabilities to
// this consensus extensions package and how kwild uses it to facilitate new
// types of live changes.
