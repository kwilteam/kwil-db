/*
	This file contains an extension that allows Kwil users to execute
	ad-hoc SQL statements. This works both in regular and view
	actions, however view actions will not be able to modify data.
	It is expected that query strings are passed as arguments in the
	action.

	It has one method, "Execute", which takes a string as an argument.
	When executed, it will execute the query against the dataset, and
	return the result. If called during a blockchain tx, the query
	can modify the underlying dataset.

	While it is mostly meant to be an example, it likely has some
	practical use cases. Some examples include:
		- 	a user might want to give users ad-hoc read access based
			on some access control / authentication mechanism.
