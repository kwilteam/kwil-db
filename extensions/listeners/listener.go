// the listener to continue running. The passed context will be
// canceled when the node is shutting down, or when it is no longer
// a validator. It is expected that any resources associated with
// the listener are cleaned up when the context is canceled. The
// function can be called many times if a node's validator status
// changes (e.g. becomes a validator, is removed as a validator, then
// becomes a validator again). The function can block indefinitely,
// but all resources should be cleaned up when the context is
