## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in this project, please DO NOT open an issue or publicly disclose the vulnerability.

There are two ways to privately report a security issue:

- Send an email to [help@kwil.com](mailto:help@kwil.com), which all code owners can access and check regularly. Tied to this email, you can use our [public key](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=help@kwil.com) to encrypt your message.

- Submit a report through GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting system](https://github.com/kwilteam/kwil-db/security/advisories/new).

Your report will be acknowledged within 24 hours, and you’ll receive a more detailed response to your report within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report.

## Disclosure Policy

In the event that we learn of a critical security vulnerability, we reserve the right to silently fix it without immediately disclosing the existence of the vulnerability.

In such a scenario, we will:

1. Silently fix the vulnerability in a new release.

2. Notify all users of the affected versions that they should upgrade to the new release.

3. After a reasonable period of time, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability, along with credit to the reporter (with their permission).

This policy is based on the Geth team's [silent patch policy](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/geth-developer/disclosures).
